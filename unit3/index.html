		<h2 class="header">Our mission</h2>
		<p>Getting through collage, our founder, Tyson Woodruff was a server. Working late hours and leaving work hungry he quickly realized that getting food late was an issue. Not many places where open and the ones that where didn’t have very exciting food. Let alone nutritious food. Here at Much-eze we’ve designed our restaurant to be readily available, nutritious and exciting. No more wishing you could have a fresh, made to order, chicken mozzarella stick taco with oven ready buffalo wing pizza at 3am. Get “munchies much easier.” </p>
